# Git & GitHub 🚀

## Why Git? 🤔

- Eraser link - https://app.eraser.io/workspace/06oTmTiO17QjeuTDkp7O

### **Problem without Git in Managing a Project:**
- **Backup** 💾
- **Tracking** 📅 – Why? It helps to track my timeline, monitor bugs, and more.
- **Collaboration** 🤝

To tackle all these challenges, we need a system to manage and maintain them efficiently.

## So, What Is the Solution? 💡

**Version Control System (VCS)** – A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool used to track and manage changes to files, projects, or codebases over time. It allows developers to collaborate effectively, revert changes, and maintain a history of modifications. Some popular tools include **Git**, **SVN**, and **Mercurial**, with **Git** being the most widely used. A VCS ensures efficiency, collaboration, and reliability in project management. 

---

## Git 🌍

The most popular VCS is **GitHub**, largely due to the branching support introduced by Linux. 🌱

To check the version of Git, run the command:  
`git --version` 🖥️

To create a folder, use:  
`mkdir file1` 📂

Then, to tell Git to track your folder:  
`git init` 🔄

### How Git Tracks Files 📁

When Git starts tracking a folder, it creates a hidden `.git` folder inside your directory. By default, it does not track any files inside the folder.

- `U` ➡️ File is **untracked**
- `A` ➡️ File is **tracked** (index added)

#### Commands:

- `git add .` ➡️ Tracks all files in the folder 🌍
- `git add <filename>` ➡️ Tracks a specific file 📝

To view the index file's content:  
`cat index` ➡️ Opens the index file (it will show compressed data).

To see the current status:  
`git status` ➡️ Displays the tracking status, last commit, and more.

### Git Commit & Checkpoints 🎮

To create a commit (a checkpoint):  
`git commit -m "Your commit message"` 🔑  
This is like saving your game progress. Every commit gets its unique **HASH ID** 🔐.

To view your commit history:  
`git log` 🔍

![Git Log](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a13f20f-41b2-495e-ad36-dc581da8d175)

To see the differences between commits:  
`git diff` 💥  
(You need to make at least one change before using this command.)

![Git Diff](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e611bbb7-23d5-4efc-b47f-a8635785ebff)

You can also view the changes directly in your VS Code UI 🖥️:

## How Git Tracks Internally 🛠️

When you make a commit, Git saves it as a unique **HASH ID** generated by the **SHA algorithm**.  
It's like a **linked list**, where each commit points to the previous one. 🔗

![Git Hash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e777236d-e45a-463f-ab49-5057aabff462)

---

With every commit, Git creates a new **HASH ID**, ensuring your project stays well-organized and easy to revert back to previous versions. 🗂️

---

# 🚨 We need to do `git add .` every time we make changes as Git treats the changed file (object) as a new one 🚨

### ℹ️ Thora extra info ℹ️

### 🔍 Now let's go a little more in depth 🔍

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b08bc2a7-77f0-4c72-bf31-48b97e549d02)

`text` → `hash` → `string`  
Git takes my file content, converts it into a HASH file using SHA algorithm. So, if we don't make any changes in the file and try to do a commit, it will not allow it because the SHA value remains the same. Git will not accept the changes.

---

### 📝 `git log --oneline` shows all commits in one line 📝

---

### 🔄 When we do `git reset <7a>` (SHA of my commit) 🔄
- All the commits are lost and the remaining are my changes.
  
But when we do `git reset --hard <7a>` all the changes, along with their commits, are gone.

### 📤 When we share a file, we can see the changes because the `.git` folder is also shared 📤

But there's a problem:
- 🤔 **What is the single source of truth (central place)?**
- 🌐 It should also be connected to the internet so that we can work remotely.

### 🏡 So, we use **GitHub** to solve these issues:
1. **Acts as a single source of truth**.
2. **Collaborator**.
3. **Provides a UI**.
4. Everyone should **push and pull from this only**, so that conflicts can be handled properly.

### 🌍 Suppose we make 3 changes in our local Git, and create a folder in GitHub. So, to connect this: 🌍

```bash```
```git remote add origin https://github.com/mohitwagishorg/git.git ``` # Connects my Git folder to GitHub folder

```git remote -v  # To check the connection status```  

```git push -u origin main  # First-time push, where 'main' is the name of the HEAD```
